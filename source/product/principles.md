We don't want merge request authors to work extra hours or otherwise rush to meet a due date.
We don't want reviewers and maintainers to be put under pressure to do anything other than meet the regular SLOs.
If it is essential that a merge request make it in a particular release, this must be communicated well in advance to the engineer and any reviewers, to ensure they're able to make that commitment. If a severe bug needs to be fixed with short notice, it is better to revert the change that introduced it than to rush, or even to delay the release until the fix is ready.
