## Communication

Orangesky values clear, concise, transparent, asynchronous, and frequent communication. Here are our most important modes of communication:

Channel | Description	
-----|-------------------
Redmine | Please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to team members at Orangesky.
Slack | Here are some common Engineering-centric channels: #dev
Meeting | Anyone at Orangesky is welcome to attend and contribute to the agenda.

<br/>

## Keeping yourself informed

It is important to stay informed about engineering-led initiatives. 
We employ multimodal communication, which describes the minimum set of communication channels we'll broadcast to.

For the Engineering, any important initiative will be announced in:

### Slack

- #eng-week-in-review
- #development
- #development-guidelines
- #production
- #security
- #quality
- #ux
- #whats-happening-at-orangesky
- #company-fyi

All engineer should become members as part of the onboarding process. If this is not the case for you, reach out to your manager.

Code | Expectations       | Related Policies
---|-------------------	| ----------------------------------------- 
C1xx | If you frequently check any of these channels, you can consider yourself informed. | 
C1xx | It is up to the person sharing to ensure that the same message is shared across all channels. |   
C1xx | The message should be a one sentence summary with a link to an issue to allow for a single source of truth for any feedback. |   

<br/>

## Prioritizing technical decisions

Priority | Description		| Issue label(s)     
---|-------------------	| ----------------------------------------- 
P1 | Security fixes | security
P2 | Data-loss prevention | data loss
P3 | Availability, Infradev, Incident Corrective Actions | availability, infradev, Corrective Action
P4 | Fixing regressions (things that worked before) | regression
P5 | Performance Refinement | Performance Refinement
P6 | Promised to Customers | planning-priority, customer, customer+
P7 | Instrumentation improvements | instrumentation
P8 | Usability Improvements and User Experience | feature::enhancement, UX debt
P9 | Identified for Dogfooding | Dogfooding
P10 | Velocity of new features, technical debt, community contributions, and all other improvements | direction, feature, technical debt
P11 | Behaviors that yield higher predictability (because this inevitably slows us down) | predictability

## Engineering Demo

Occasionally, it may be useful to set up a demo on a regular cadence to ensure cross-functional iterative alignment. 
This is helpful for high-impact deliverables that require integration across multiple functional teams. 

1. Record a video on your computer or via Google Meet livestream of the working software.
2. Post the video link to the appropriate Slack channel.

Grade | Definition       
------|-----------------------------------------------------	
D5    | Signed off from all Stakeholders.  
D4    | Demo'd according to the "definition of done". 
D3    | Demo'd but incomplete and/or has bugs  
D2    | Demo'd in some rudimentary state, work has started    
D1    | Not yet started or cannot be demo'd

### Resources for Development


Code | Expectations       | Related Policies
---|-------------------	| ----------------------------------------- 
C1xx | Consider the cost and whether anything can be done to reduce the cost. | 
C1xx | You can boot up as many machines as you need. |  
C1xx | It is your responsibility to clean up after yourself; if a machine is not used, remove it. |  
C1xx | If you observe any resource that is running for long periods of time, ask the person responsible whether the machine is still in use. |  
C1xx | Prepend your username to any resource you start. Eg. if your name is "`Ricky Wang`", name the resource "`rickywang-machine-for-testing`"|
