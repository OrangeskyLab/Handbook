# About Orangesky

> Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.
> Please assign [merge requests](https://github.com/OrangeskyLab/Handbook/compare) to update these values to our CEO and `@mention` him in [Slack](https://orangeskyhq.slack.com) if you work at Orangesky Lab Inc. or on [Telegram](https://t.me/orangeskylab) if you don't.

## Values


Our 5 values are:

- 📈 **Results**
- 👣 **Iteration**
- 👁️ **Transparency**
- ⏱️ **Efficiency**
- 💡 **Creativity**

Our values govern how we behave. They describe our expectations from the people we hire. They help guide us on how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision-making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.

### 📈 Results

Code | Values	| Expectations       | Related Policies
---|-------------------	| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------
A101 | **Measure results not hours** | We care about what you achieve. But if you are working too many hours, talk to your manager to discuss solutions.| Logging Time
A102 | **Dogfooding** |  We use our own product. | 
A103 | **Give agency** |  We give people agency to focus on what they think is most beneficial. | 
A104 | **Write promises down** |  Agree in writing on measurable goals. Within the company we use public OKRs for that. | OKRs
A105 | **Growth mindset** |  You don't always get results and this will lead to criticism from yourself and/or others.   | 
A106 | **Global optimization** |  You do what is best for the organization as a whole.  | 
A107 | **Tenacity** |  You keep picking yourself up and quickly get going again having learned a little more. | 
A108 | **Ownership** | We expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. | Issue tracking
A109 | **Sense of urgency** | Try to get the results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and ways we communicate. | 
A110 | **Ambitious** | While we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results. | OKRs
A111 | **Perseverance** | We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed. | 
A112 | **Disagree, commit, and disagree** | Everything can be questioned, but as long as a decision is in place, we expect people to commit to executing it. | 
A113 | **Accepting uncertainty** |  The best way to drive out that uncertainty is not by layering analysis and conjecture over it, but rather by accepting it and moving forward. | 
A114 | **Escalate to unblock**	 | Early escalation, delivered with context of the challenge, enables people to function as an unblocker. | DRI
A115 | **Customer results**	 | Our focus is to improve the results that customers achieve. | CD

#### 📈✅ Competency

We demonstrate results when we do what we promised to each other, customers, users, and investors.
