We can use the expertise and bandwidth we’ve built in past years to raise our bar even higher and to make timely, high-quality hires. We rely primarily on the judgment of our hiring managers to do this while including direct reports in hiring future team members. But we also try to systematize as much as possible so our hiring practices are fair, transparent, and repeatable. We require that at least two interviewers of the engineering division give each candidate a Strong Yes (the highest assessment available in our applicant tracking system) on their interview scorecard in order to move to the offer stage. The two-star rule applies to anyone added to the pipeline as of Monday, March 16, 2020. Any candidacy in the interview process prior to this can be held to the previous one-star rule. Hiring managers must review the scorecards and make sure All the must-have requirements have been assessed and are met for the role A simple majority of nice-to-have requirements (usually 5 of 9) are met for the role The justification has sufficient detail and addresses any flags, no votes, prior rejections, or not meeting the criteria as above Hiring managers must do a write up as part of advancing a candidate to offer. This can be found in the Justification section of the interview plan in Greenhouse. In what specific way(s) does this person make the team better? What red flags were raised during the interview process? What are our specific strategies to set this person up for success? If a candidate was previously rejected for a role the hiring manager needs review the previous interview experience (if our data retention policy allows), discuss with the previous hiring manager and address why the person has now met our qualifications Is the offer in-plan, and why? Critical budgeted hire, backfills, or transfer, etc. We do not run a single-veto hiring process because this impedes our ability to uplevel our teams. High-performers are more likely to have been the product of a controversial hiring process because they challenge the status quo. But that does not mean every controversial hiring process yields a high performer. An important part of a hiring manager’s performance is making these determinations. Headcount planning Before the beginning of each fiscal year, and at various check points throughout the year, we plan the size and shape of the Engineering and Product Management functions together to maintain symmetry. The process should take place in a single artifact (usually a spreadsheet, current spreadsheet), and follow these steps: Product Management: Supplies headcount numbers for PMs and development groups proportional to our roadmap efforts Engineering: Supplies feedback on headcount planning to Product, headcount for management roles in the development department, full plans for the Security, UX, Quality, and Infrastructure departments, and is the DRI for ensuring team structure aligns with guidance on span of control (points 5 and 6) or an exception is warranted.` CEO: Supplies feedback to Engineering and Product, or gives final approval Note: Support is part of the engineering function but is budgeted as ‘cost of sales’ instead of research and development. Headcount planning is done separately according to a different model. R&amp;D Backfill Process Whenever a team member departs from GitLab or they transfer to a different role, the below process should be followed to open a backfill. This process ensures alignment between the Department Heads, Finance business partner and Talent Acquisition. For departures, a backfill can only be opened once a departure or resignation is official where we’ve received written confirmation of the departure including the last working day and the People Business Partner has submitted the Offboarding Form to the People Ops team. For transfers, a backfill can only be opened once a transfer is official where an offer letter stating the transfer date has been completed. Manager: Manager is made aware of team member departure (either through our voluntary, involuntary offboarding) or transfer process. Manager: Manager shares the offboarding or transfer with their People Business Partner and direct manager, up to their Department Head. Department Head: The department head fills out the backfill workflow via the backfills-r-and-d private Slack channel.
